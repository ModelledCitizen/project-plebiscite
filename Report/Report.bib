@article{Brendan:2917aa,
	Abstract = {The widespread availability of voter files has improved the study of participation in American politics, but the lack of comprehensive data on nonregistrants creates difficult inferential issues. Most notably, observational studies that examine turnout rates among registrants often implicitly condition on registration, a posttreatment variable that can induce bias if the treatment of interest also affects the likelihood of registration. We introduce a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential bias induced by this problem, which we call differential registration bias. Our approach is most helpful for studies that estimate turnout among registrants using posttreatment registration data, but it is also valuable for studies that estimate turnout among the voting‚Äêeligible population using secondary sources. We illustrate our approach with two studies of voting eligibility effects on subsequent turnout among young voters. In both cases, eligibility appears to decrease turnout, but these effects are found to be highly sensitive to differential registration bias.},

@article{Achen:1975aa,
	Abstract = {Students of public opinion research have argued that voters show very little consistency and structure in their political attitudes. A model of the survey response is proposed which takes account of the vagueness in opinion survey questions and in response categories. When estimates are made of this vagueness or ``measurement error'' and the estimates applied to the principal previous study, nearly all the inconsistency is shown to be the result of the vagueness of the questions rather than of any failure by the respondents.},

Since that time, MSHC Partners has continued that work and today is the only political communications firm with a full-time Targeting Department doing advanced modeling. The New Political Targeting was published in 2003 to bring microtargeting to campaigns nationwide. Since that time these techniques have been widely adopted by campaigns, political parties and interest groups throughout America. Now, Hal Malchow has written a new, expanded edition that shares new developments in the targeting fields and provides explanations for the average campaign about more advanced microtargeting techniques. Malchow offers new data to help predict candidate support, voter persuadability, turnout and the audiences that will respond to the messages most often used in politics today. The second edition of Political Targeting comes complete with a program to help you find your ideal targets and determine the most efficient means of communicating with them.},

It considers why this election was so unusual from a political marketing perspective, calling for new explanations and discussions about its implications for mainstream political marketing theory and practice. At a time of political upheaval, candidates from both parties \textendash{} Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in particular \textendash{} have appeared to overturn the conventional wisdom that has hitherto dominated U.S. politics: that candidates should appear `presidential', be politically experienced and qualified to run for office, and avoid controversial and politically incorrect positions. This book presents scholarly perspectives and research with practitioner-relatable content on practices and discourses that look specifically at the Trump, Clinton and Sanders campaigns and how they took current understandings of political marketing and branding in new directions.},

@book{Newman:2016aa,
	Abstract = {In 2008, Barack Obama's presidential campaign used an innovative combination of social media, big data, and micro-targeting to win the White House. In 2012, the campaign did it again, further honing those marketing tools and demonstrating that political marketing is on the cutting edge when it comes to effective branding, advertising, and relationship-building. The challenges facing a presidential campaign may be unique to the political arena, but the creative solutions are not. The Marketing Revolution in Politics shows how recent US presidential campaigns have adopted the latest marketing techniques and how organizations in the for-profit and non-profit sectors can benefit from their example. Distilling the marketing practices of successful political campaigns down into seven key lessons, Bruce I. Newman shows how organizations of any size can apply the same innovative, creative, and cost-effective marketing tactics as today's presidential hopefuls. A compelling study of marketing in the make-or-break world of American politics, this book should be a must-read for managers, students of marketing and political marketing, and anyone interested in learning more about how presidential campaigns operate. Winner of the 2016 International Book Award in the "Business: Marketing \& Advertising" category.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning has become a pivotal tool for many projects in computational biology, bioinformatics, and health informatics. Nevertheless, beginners and biomedical researchers often do not have enough experience to run a data mining project effectively, and therefore can follow incorrect practices, that may lead to common mistakes or over-optimistic results. With this review, we present ten quick tips to take advantage of machine learning in any computational biology context, by avoiding some common errors that we observed hundreds of times in multiple bioinformatics projects. We believe our ten suggestions can strongly help any machine learning practitioner to carry on a successful project in computational biology and related sciences.},
